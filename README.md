# Foundations

Basically I want to teach all of the foundational concepts that students will need in courses 2 and 3. 

## Unix Shell (weeks 1-2)

## Version control using Git and GitHub (weeks 3-4)

## Programming using Python (weeks 5-7)

## Relational databases (weeks 8-10)
Relational databases are a common way to store large data sets with complex structure. The ability to work with databases is a hugely important skill for any budding data scientist.  Weeks 8-10 of the course will focus on relational databases using SQL.

Much of the above material I covered in the first 3 days of the computational methods workshop for SGPE students. The idea is that, for this first course, I would cover largely the same material but at a *much* slower pace. I also plan to re-write, where necessary, the Software Carpentry lectures in order to better motivate the example use-cases for an economic audience.
